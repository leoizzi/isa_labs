\chapter{Synthesis}

For the synthesis we have followed the standard flow used in the previous laboratory sessions, hence we will
not repeat it here.

We synthesized both the processors. The critical path lies in the EXE's adder, hence they have a very similar critical
path and requires $2.7\ ns$ to be traversed.

Even the area occupation is similar, as the functional unit added to \verb|riscv_abs| is rather small. Indeed, the total
area difference between the two versions is $\sim 2\%$.
Below are reported the area results.
