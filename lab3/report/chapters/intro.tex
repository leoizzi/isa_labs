\chapter{Introduction}

In this lab we had to develop a scalar, in-order, RISC-V-lite processor. To the base unit, as a second task,
we had to add a special functional unit to compute the absolute value of a number.

As required, there is a GitHub repository available at the following link: \url{https://github.com/leoizzi/isa_labs/tree/main/lab3}.

The processors are separated in two different folders, in \verb|riscv| there is the base model while in \verb|riscv_abs| there is
the extended one. The folders share the same structure, hence it is reported only once:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|innovus|: it contains all the files produced during the place and route by Innovus.
    \item \verb|netlist|: it contains the output of the synthesis process.
    \item \verb|sim|: it contains all the simulation-related files, such as the data to initialize the RAM and the ROM, as well as the simulation script.
    \item \verb|src|: it contains the processor's source files to be synthesized and simulated.
    \item \verb|syn|: it contains the synthesis scripts.
    \item \verb|tb|: it contains all the testbenches developed to test the units and the processor itself.
\end{itemize}
