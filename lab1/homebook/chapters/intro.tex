\chapter{Introduction}

Our assignment was to implement a 2nd order IIR filter on 12 bits. For this architecture we have implemented, as required,
first a Matlab model, then a C model and finally the actual VHDL model.
A note on the filter order: to obtain its value we have considered the space character in "Dai Pr\`a".

As required, we have also created a GitHub repository, available at the following link: \url{https://github.com/leoizzi/isa_labs/tree/main/lab1}.
