	1) homebook.tex
	2) master.tex (called in the homebook code)


Before reading try a compilation and see the results:

	type twice:  	prompt> latex homebook
			prompt> latex homebook

	a '.dvi' file si generated. To see it type:
		
			prompt> xdvi homebook.dvi &

	to generate a pdf of the output type:

			prompt> dvipdfm homebook.dvi

	and to see the results type:

			prompt> acroread homebook.pdf
