\chapter{Introduction}

In this laboratory session we have learned the principles behind UVM and how to test both combinational and sequential circuits.
As required, there is a GitHub repository available at the following link: \url{https://github.com/leoizzi/isa_labs/tree/main/lab4}.

There are three top folders, which are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|adder|, where the test of the given adder has been performed.
    \item \verb|fpmult|, where the test of the whole floating point multiplier has been performed.
    \item \verb|mult|, where the test of the MBE-Dadda tree multiplier has been performed.
\end{itemize}

Each of these folders has the same structure, which is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|sim|, the folder containing all the transcripts produced by QuestaSim.
    \item \verb|src|, the folder containing the files related to the DUT.
    \item \verb|tb|, the folder containing all the files related to the verification.
\end{itemize}
