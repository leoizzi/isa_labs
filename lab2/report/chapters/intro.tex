\chapter{Introduction}

Our assignment was to implement a 2nd order IIR filter on 12 bits. For this architecture we have implemented, as required,
first a Matlab model, then a C model and finally the actual VHDL model.
A note on the filter order: to obtain its value we have considered the space character in "Dai Pr\`a".

As required, we have also created a GitHub repository, available at the following link: \url{https://github.com/leoizzi/isa_labs/tree/main/lab1}.

The folders are organized as follows: in \verb|isa_labs/lab1| there are \verb|iir| and \verb|iir_opt|. The former contains the Matlab model, C model
and VHDL model of the standard IIR, while the latter contains the C model and the VHDL model of the improved filter.
