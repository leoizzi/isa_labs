\chapter{Introduction}

The lab 2 assignment consisted in various synthesis experiments on a floating point multiplier and in the development of a unsigned integer multiplier,
based on the Booth's algorithm and Dadda's tree, to be used within the floating point multiplier.

As required, there is a GitHub repository available at the following link: \url{https://github.com/leoizzi/isa_labs/tree/main/lab2}.

The folder is organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|fpuvhdl|, the folder containing all the VHDL files of both the floating point and integer unsigned multipliers.
    \item \verb|lab2_report.pdf|, this file.
    \item \verb|report|, the folder containing the Latex files of the report.
    \item \verb|sim|, the folder where all the simulation scripts are stored.
    \item \verb|syn|, the folder where all the synthesis script, as well as the reports, are saved.
    \item \verb|tb|, the folder containing the testbench files.
    \item \verb|dadda.py|, a python script that generates the VHDL instantiation of the Dadda tree.
\end{itemize}
